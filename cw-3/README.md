# Coursework 3 - Prolog programming

Code and report source for my third SDCAI coursework. 

Tasks were based on solving a generate-and-test problem with Prolog.

Also included is my Haskell implementation of the functionality asked for by the CW. This was not required or submitted, but was still an interesting programming task.
